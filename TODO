* More unit tests to be added as not all functions are being covered by tests, notably 3D plots, such as contourplots and heatmaps.
* Further refactoring.
* Plotting styles have been added to gnuplot since this interface library was completed, hence further testing and documentation on this.
* More field testing is needed: 
  - Does the current version still work on Windows / OS-X / other operating systems? 
  - How does it perform in high-volume or high-performance environments?
  - Are there limitations which need to be looked at, for example the maximum amount of open gnuplot files (GP_MAX_TMP_FILES)?
  - Does it still work if gnuplot is installed but qt or wxWidgets is not?
* The file gnuplot_i.txt can probably be marked down.
