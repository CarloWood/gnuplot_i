Color palettes for gnuplot
==========================

More [examples](http://www.gnuplotting.org/ease-your-plotting-with-config-snippets/).

Most of the palettes are from [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/) and were
first ported to gnuplot by [Anna Schneider](https://github.com/aschn/gnuplot-colorbrewer).

A good enterprise-grade palette is `moreland.palette` from
[Kenneth Moreland](https://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-maps/).
