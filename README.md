gnuplot interface to C
======================

This is a modification of the `gnuplot_i` library by Nicolas Devillard, which adds the following functionality:

*    3D plots, using `gnuplot_splot(handle, x, y, z, n, "title")`
*    Set z-axis labels with `gnuplot_set_zlabel(handle, "z-axis label")`
*    Produce color PostScript files with `gnuplot_hardcopy_colour(handle, "graph.ps")`
*    Windows support, added in September 2005
*    Plot complex structures through the use of callbacks, see `gnuplot_plot_obj_xy` and `gnuplot_splot_obj`
*    Contour plotting, using `gnuplot_setstyle(handle, "lines")` and `gnuplot_contour_plot(handle, x, y, z, nx, ny, "title")`
