gnuplot C interface library
===========================

This is a modification of the gnuplot_i library by Nicolas Devillard, which enables developers to create gnuplots from their C programs. It features the following enhancements:

* 3D plots, using `gnuplot_splot(handle, x, y, z, n, "title")`.
* Setting z-axis labels with `gnuplot_set_zlabel(handle, "z-axis label")`.
* Production of colour PostScript files with `gnuplot_hardcopy_colour(handle, "graph.ps")`.
* Windows support.
* On OS X, if DISPLAY environment variable is not set, or USE_AQUA=1, then aqua is used instead of x11.
* Plotting of complex structures through the use of callbacks, see `gnuplot_plot_obj_xy` and `gnuplot_splot_obj`.
* Contour plotting with `gnuplot_setstyle(handle, "lines")` and `gnuplot_contour_plot(handle, x, y, z, nx, ny, "title")`.
